For me, this is the perfect breakfast, and I eat it every morning. I do experiment with different ingredients, but the recipe here is what I make most often. 

Serves one

### Ingredients
* 85 grams (½ cup) steel cut oats
* 25 grams walnuts
* 30 grams raw almonds
* 5 grams (½ tablespoon) sunflower seeds  
* 10 grams (1 tablespoon) pepitas
* 10 grams (1 tablespoon) dried goji berries
* 5 grams (½ tablespoon) hemp seeds
* 35 grams pitted dried dates - chopped into chunks
* 5 grams (½ tablespoon) bee pollen
* 20 grams (1 tablespoon) honey. I use raw TA15+ Jarrah honey.  
* 1 pinch of cinnamon

### Method
1. Add 1½ cups of cold water to the steel cut oats in a small thick bottom saucepan and begin simmering over a low heat for 15-20 mins. Soak oats overnight to speed up this process. 
2. Add walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, pepitas goji berries and hemp seeds to a spice grinder or small food processor and grind to a coarse powder. 
3. Once oats reach the desired consistency, add the powder from step two, with bee pollen, chopped dates and cinnamon.   
4. Stir through honey and adjust to desired sweetness.   

Tips:
