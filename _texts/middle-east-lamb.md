This is one of my wife Kylie's favourite dishes. We often have a few serves of this dish in the freezer as back-up meals for lazy nights. Although there are a lot of ingredients, this is a pretty simple recipe, and it's super nutritious.

*Note step 1 should be done the day before you cook*

**Preparation time:** 25 minutes

**Cooking time:** 3 hours

**Serves 6**

### Ingredients

* 200g buckwheat
* 2 tablespoons of coconut or olive oil
* 4 lamb shanks (~1.8kg) or lamb pieces
* 1 large brown onion, chopped
* 2 sticks of celery, chopped
* 6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground tumeric
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* big pinch of safron threads
* 400g tin diced tomatoes
* 2 litres of lamb or chicken stock
* 2 cups of diced sweet potato
* salt and pepper
* 2 cups of diced pumpkin
* 2 large zucchini, diced
* 1 bunch of kale, silverbeet or spinach, chopped 
* 1 handful corriander leaves, chopped
* 1 handful mint leaves
* 2 lemons, cut into wedges to serve


### Method

1. Soak the buckwheat overnight in water, then drain well the next day.
2. Melt a the in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the lamb shanks and brown on all sides. Remove and set aside. 
3. Reduce heat to medium and add the onion and celery to the pan. Saute, stiring occasionally for 4-5 minutes.
4. Add the garlic and spices. 

### Variations

1. Subsitiute lamb, for chicken legs or eliminate meat for a vegetarian version. 
2. Adding 2-3 whisked egg whites at the end is pretty good!
