My uncle Stu makes these pancakes for his family every Sunday morning. It produces pancakes just how I like 'em. Nice and flat without the cake like texture.

### Ingredients
* 250 grams flour
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 60 grams butter 
* 3 eggs


### Method
1. Melt butter and combine with the milk together.
2. Beat eggs and flour together and combine and then combine with the butter and milk and mix until smooth and has the consistency of thick cream.
