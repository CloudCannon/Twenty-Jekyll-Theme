My fig tree is laden with fruit at the moment so I've been experimenting with fig sorbet recipes. Here's what I've come up with so far. 

Preperation time: 

Cooking time: 

### Ingredients

* ~500 grams of ripe figs
* 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup of caster sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon of rosewater (optional)
* 100ml tawny port

### Method

1. Slice the ends of the figs and then halve.
2. Grate the zest from the lemon. 
3. Place the figs in a saucepan with 1/2 cup of water over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
4. Add the lemon zest and stir the mixture 2-3 times over the next 10 minutes or until figs are soft.
5. Add the 1/2 cup of caster to the fig mixture and simmer until the fig mixture becomes syrupy.
6. Remove the fig mixure from the heat and puree with a stab mixer or in a blender (remember this is hot).
7. Add the 100ml of tawny port, rosewater and juice of 1/2 lemon to the puree mix throughly.
8. Place in the refridgerator to cool completely. 
9. While the puree is cooling, start up the ice cream maker and get it as cool as possible. 
10. Once the ice cream maker and puree are a cold as possible, pour the puree into the ice cream mashine and churn fo 30-60 minutes. If large crystals begin to form, remove the sorbet and pulse with a stab mixer quicky and return to the machine and continue churining. 
11. Place on the freezer for at least 2-3 hours. 
12. Voila! A decadent fig sorbet. If your feeling fancy, garnish with some fresh mint.

#### Notes
The alcohol in the port helps inhibit the sorbet from solidifying so it can be easily scooped. If alcohol is an issue, perhaps try substituting the port with orange juice or something else sweet.
